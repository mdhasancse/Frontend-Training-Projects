                        This is particularly useful if you're trying to do this programmatically (e.g., to automate some

                        However, in my opinion, it's not worth creating a tool simply to escape the double-quotations.
                        You can easily do that in any text editor (e.g., Notepad) using the "Find and Replace" utility.
                        But if you think a tool would make things easier for you, then go ahead. </p>
